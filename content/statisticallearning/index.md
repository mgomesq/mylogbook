Here are organized my study notes on the 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning Book'.
This is an awesome book! The reading flows very smoothly between the pages.

You can find more information on the book [here](https://www.statlearning.com/). It is freely available online, but I bought a hard copy.
There is also an [online course](https://www.statlearning.com/online-course) on the book, which I found out later.
It will serve me good in reinforcing what I learn.
